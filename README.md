WHAT IS KUBERNETES?
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.
Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.


BENFITS
Scalability:      Software can be deployed for the first time in a scale-out manner across Pods, and deployments can be scaled in or out at any time.
Visibility:       Identify completed, in-process, and failing deployments with status querying capabilities.
Time savings:     Pause a deployment at any time and resume it later.
Version control:  Update deployed Pods using newer versions of application images and roll back to an earlier deployment if the current version is not stable.
